ά In Attic this is a rising pitch
ὰ In Attic this means maintain the pitch, possibly drop it
ῶ In Attic this is is a rising then falling pitch.

The iota subscript, the mark under the eta ῃ, is silent in every pronunciation but Attic. It is a short "i" sound.

Breathing marks in koine and and modern are silent. In Attic and Erasmian:

ὀ is a smooth breathing. It is silent
ὁ Is a rough breathing. In Attic and Erasmian it is pronounced "h" as in "Hulk."

In addition modern has ντ as either "d" as in "Drax" or "nd" as in "Mandalorian." Also μβ is either "mb" (both letters pronounced) or just "b."
